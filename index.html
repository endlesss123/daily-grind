To get the full affect, gently stir coffee, around with the milk. Therefore you will be introduce with the taste of chocolate, with a hint of milk, therefore our Friday special. To end the week, we like to introduce our Saturday special, Frappaccino once again, based on popular request.

Like always you can always top it off, with whipped cream, but if that is not enough for you, you can also add a drizzle of syrups as well.One of most top flavors are caramel syrups, just add a drizzle on top of the whipped cream, will add another edge of sweetness in your mouth.
